Answers to your questions are as follows:

	"What is the earliest date you can start?"
	mid-June would be best for me.  But, I can start earlier if you need help immediately.

	"Do you need visa sponsorship or transfer? If yes, please state the type of visa you are currently on and would need a transfer for?"
	No. I am an American citizen of the USA.

	"We are expecting candidates to commute to our Redwood City office once the Shelter-In-Place orders are lifted and its safe for employees to do so. Please let us know if this is not possible for you."
	Yes, this is good.  I am looking forward to meeting the other people at Miles in person.


Have a good day

-Gabriel
